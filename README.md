<h1>Udemy's Web Developement Edge: Strengths, Gaps, & Opportunities</h1>

<h2>Notes Regarding the Data</h2>
When analyzing the average ratings, values with “Not Available” were converted to NaN using Python and filtered out of the dataset. 

Both Python and simple functions in Excel/Google Sheets were used to clean and format the data. 

To help analyze the data for Udemy content against Competitor A’s content, the course level “expert” was updated to “advanced” to better match for comparison. 

A quick analysis was done to better evaluate courses by subtopic. Key words/phrases such as “API”, “Django”, etc. were extracted and used to help filter by subtopic. Further analysis can be done here to drill down further to gain more insight into the Web Development offerings.

<h2>Strengths</h2>
Based on a 5.0 rating scale, Udemy courses have a higher average rating compared to Competitor A. Looking at the subtopics contained within this visualization, you can see that most subtopics rank higher than Competitor A, however, there is still room for improvement (see discussion of weaknesses below).

Udemy has put forth substantial effort toward maintaining and updating its course content. With the rapid changes in technology, it is highly important that course material stay relevant, so students get the most out of their time and can rapidly implement with real world web development applications. When reviewing the data of the total number of courses offered and how many of those courses were updated within the last 12 months, Udemy has clearly outperformed Competitor A by updating nearly 60% of their web development courses. Competitor A falls short with only 20% of their courses being updated in the last 12 months.

Comparing the level of course offerings provides another unique insight to how well Udemy also outperforms Competitor A. To assist in reviewing the data, Udemy’s “expert” level course was renamed as “advanced” to align with Competitor A’s data. Second, to help gain a better understanding of how the levels of instruction directly compare between the competitors, Udemy’s “All levels” courses were not heavily analyzed from this data set and the focus was mainly geared towards the “beginner”, “intermediate”, and “advanced” levels of instruction. When looking at the data based on total hours of content and instruction level, Udemy offers more hours of content across each level as compared to Competitor A. Looking within Udemy’s Web Development catalog, their available content is geared most towards beginner level learners, as the hours of Beginner instruction is more than double that of their Intermediate and Advanced levels of content. This is a strength because it attracts new and curious customers/learners to start their learning path to further Udemy courses.
