<h1>Udemy's Web Developement Edge: Strengths, Gaps, & Opportunities</h1>

<h2>Notes Regarding the Data</h2>
When analyzing the average ratings, values with “Not Available” were converted to NaN using Python and filtered out of the dataset. 

Both Python and simple functions in Excel/Google Sheets were used to clean and format the data. 

To help analyze the data for Udemy content against Competitor A’s content, the course level “expert” was updated to “advanced” to better match for comparison. 

A quick analysis was done to better evaluate courses by subtopic. Key words/phrases such as “API”, “Django”, etc. were extracted and used to help filter by subtopic. Further analysis can be done here to drill down further to gain more insight into the Web Development offerings.

<h2>Strengths</h2>
Based on a 5.0 rating scale, Udemy courses have a higher average rating compared to Competitor A. Looking at the subtopics contained within this visualization, you can see that most subtopics rank higher than Competitor A, however, there is still room for improvement (see discussion of weaknesses below).

Udemy has put forth substantial effort toward maintaining and updating its course content. With the rapid changes in technology, it is highly important that course material stay relevant, so students get the most out of their time and can rapidly implement with real world web development applications. When reviewing the data of the total number of courses offered and how many of those courses were updated within the last 12 months, Udemy has clearly outperformed Competitor A by updating nearly 60% of their web development courses. Competitor A falls short with only 20% of their courses being updated in the last 12 months.

Comparing the level of course offerings provides another unique insight to how well Udemy also outperforms Competitor A. To assist in reviewing the data, Udemy’s “expert” level course was renamed as “advanced” to align with Competitor A’s data. Second, to help gain a better understanding of how the levels of instruction directly compare between the competitors, Udemy’s “All levels” courses were not heavily analyzed from this data set and the focus was mainly geared towards the “beginner”, “intermediate”, and “advanced” levels of instruction. When looking at the data based on total hours of content and instruction level, Udemy offers more hours of content across each level as compared to Competitor A. Looking within Udemy’s Web Development catalog, their available content is geared most towards beginner level learners, as the hours of Beginner instruction is more than double that of their Intermediate and Advanced levels of content. This is a strength because it attracts new and curious customers/learners to start their learning path to further Udemy courses.

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

Udemy’s high average course rating is an indicator of the high quality of the courses and customers’ overall satisfaction with content available. From a business perspective, this attracts new users who value feedback from previous learners prior to committing to a course, as well as increases user retention. Retention could be realized as a user signing up for higher level courses within a given subtopic to deepen their knowledge or beginning courses in a separate area of web development to broaden their knowledge.

The depth, breadth, and freshness of Udemy’s offerings with frequent updates to course content meets the needs of customers and businesses in today’s fast-paced and changing tech stack to stay relevant.

Udemy offers a wide range of instructional levels. This is important as users need a beginner-to-expert path, and Udemy provides them one consolidated place to follow it.

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>

Based on the data, it seems that the focus for content by Udemy is geared towards Beginner or All Levels tracks. I believe there is significant room for growth by creating more hours of content for intermediate and advanced users. 

Diving deeper on this, if you narrow down by subtopic, you can see that some technologies are lacking in Advanced course options. For instance, courses pertaining to Django, Full Stack, and API do not have Advanced levels of instruction available. Other topics such as Security are only offered at the Intermediate level by Udemy. Whereas Competitor A offers both Beginner and Intermediate levels of instruction. I recommend Udemy fill these gaps within their Web Development category to maintain their competitive edge in the market.

An additional area of weakness based on the data can be seen when viewing the top 10 instructors as ranked by their average rating. Looking at these values in the data, it appears that 8 out of the 10 instructors only have 1 course available. While 4 out of the 10 instructors have less than 10 hours of content. Per this data, the top 10 instructors are underutilized and should be considered when making new content to fill gaps for new Web Development courses.
